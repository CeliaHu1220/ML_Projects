## Introduction 
This application seeks to unite some of the largest datasets related to music that is available on
the internet in order to provide the user with a more streamlined way to access interesting details
about songs, artists, and genres. One idea that todayâ€™s music streaming platforms fundamentally
lack is the ability to understand why certain music is appealing to wider audiences or why the
listener might find a particular artist or song appealing. In other words, we ask the question: what
qualities of artists, songs, or genres make them rise to the top? To do this, we unite datasets about
songs (Audio Features Dataset), global audience preferences (Billboard Top 100), and ratings
(Pitchfork Dataset).
